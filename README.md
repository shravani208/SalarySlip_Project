# SalarySlip_Project
A salary slip project involves creating a system or document to generate and provide detailed information about an employee's earnings and deductions for a specific pay period. So basically our mini project includes details such as the employee's basic salary, allowances and deductions like provident fund and displays employee's Gross Salary.
